# 🐍 ALX Back-End Python Exercises

Welcome to the **ALX BE Python** repo. A personal collection of Python exercises completed as part of the [ALX Back-End Development](https://ehub.alxafrica.com/program/BE) program. This repository documents my journey through foundational and intermediate Python concepts, with projects organized by topic and learning module.
